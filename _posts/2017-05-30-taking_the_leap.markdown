Since I joined the workforce seven years ago, I’ve been struggling to find my path.  Every time I logged into social media or caught up with old friends, I’d hear of their passions, of their drive to excel in their respective professions.  Multiple times, I thought I’d found my calling.  I’d join a company, and be fascinated by the new procedures, the new beginnings, and the new teams I was working with.  But then things always got stale.  

I take full responsibility for my boredom.   My Gemini tendencies always lead me to join a new team, revamp the entire process, streamline workflows, and then get bored.  It’s been four years since I joined the company I currently work for, and I’ve already been a part of four different departments.  I just love new beginnings.  I enjoy coming into a project and improving on the procedures and processes that make it happen.  Usually my new teammates are excited by my ideas and embrace my “let’s start from scratch” attitude.  Then, two months later, when I want to change everything again, I get on everyone’s nerves.  It’s totally understandable, but I can’t help it.  As I work, all I see is ways to make the process better.  

Enter Programming: 

On one of my many projects at work, I acted as a team’s connection to our technology vendors to come up with a brand new paperless workflow.  The feeling of starting something brand new that could simplify and enhance our daily job was amazing.  I planned the entire thing with the developers.  It was astounding to me that they could take our input, create something out of nothing, and come back with functioning and beautiful workflows.  I wanted to learn how to do that.  So I looked into coding, and found an amazing group of ladies in the LA chapter of Girl Develop It.  They embraced my curiosity and welcomed me to numerous weekend courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

At one of our monthly events, I realized why programming had grasped my attention and kept it for longer than I thought was possible.  One of the mentors at our meeting said, “You’re never really done with any coding project.”  Everyone started sharing instances where they finished a project only to come back to it a month later, think its garbage, and overhaul the whole thing.  That was the kind of work I wanted to be doing.  Forever changing, forever interesting, sometimes infuriatingly complex, but coding had everything I was looking for. 

I kept coding as a hobby for the most part of a year before I decided to take the leap.  As has been the case with many of my projects and hobbies, I thought I’d loose interest in it.  But after a year of taking weekend long courses, or spending hours at a time staring at CSS code on a mock up website, I realized this is what I really enjoy.  I looked around, and realized what a commodity it was to be able to keep my job and learn a new trade at the same time.  The Flatiron School online web developer program seemed amazing but still out of reach financially.  Then, I received one of the Birchbox Women Take Tech scholarships, and realized I had to take the plunge.  It was now or never.  I’ve been enrolled in the program for two months now, and loving every minute of it. 

Even after a couple of weeks, I kept waiting for my curiosity to vanish, or my lack of formal training to catch up to me.  But the support that we receive as students in the program has been amazing.  Even when I think “this is it.  This is the problem I just can’t solve”, there’s someone there to boost my confidence, or just make me sit down and explain my code until I figure out what the goal of the assignment is, and how to complete it.  I’m about to get started on my student projects, and I’m so nervous and excited.  I can’t wait to get home from work and get to play on Learn.  I took the leap, and it was worth it.  I’ve learned so much already.  I can’t wait to see what’s ahead.
